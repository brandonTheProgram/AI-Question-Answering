# AI-Question-Answering

During my internsship with the Department of Transportation(DOT) with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, I created a graphical user interface, tested various 'question answering' libraries and also experimented with topic modeling and ways to visualize a corpus. Question answering is a segment of AI which uses natural language processing (NLP) to enable chatbots, virtual assistants, and other applications to answer a question from a human user on a certain topic, subject domain, or it can be very general in nature.

My project is able to take in documents as input and allow the user to perfrom question answering.
